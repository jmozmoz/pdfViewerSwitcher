pdfViewerSwitcher
=================

Firefox addon to reload a pdf in Adobe Acrobat plugin viewer. If a pdf was
loaded in the internal firefox pdf viewer (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/pdfjs/)
and the user wants to load this file into the Adobe Acrobat plugin viewer, the file can be 
reloaded by a new toolbar button and/or by a new context menu entry.

Then the toolbar button can also be used to reload the file in the internal viewer again.
